excerpt: "About Neil Wang"

I am a backend centric full-stack engineer.

I'm open to relocation opportunities, especially to cities with a large tech population. I'm currently based in Virginia.

I love working on personal projects and bouncing ideas off of friends. I'm inspired by projects created with love, such as Dwarf Fortress (Seriously, go read about the creator). 

One day, I hope my work becomes irrelevant because a machine can do it better, and I hope I can contribute to the cause.
