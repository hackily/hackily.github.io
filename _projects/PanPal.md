PanPal is an android application that aims to help you manage your pantry.

The application uses the zxing library to scan barcodes, and a UPC API to identify the item, before storing your items on your device's local memory.

## Inspiration

My pantry back at home is simply a mess. It's not organized in any shape or form, and I don't really know what I have. I would walk into the grocery store, wondering if I should buy some dried beans or some cream of mushroom soup, not realizing that I already had those items.
## What it does

This app helps you keep track of what you have - and is able to easily filter through your inventory. This way, you will know exactly what you have in your pantry, without having to dig through its depths.
