Cryptocurrency as a topic fascinates me. I have a decent amount of it, and if I ever so wished, I could cash it out. But at the rate that the prices rise? It seems unlikely that I would maximize value by cashing out.

So what if there were a way to slowly grow the amount of bitcoin that I have? If I could give away bitcoin, generate ad revenue, and buy more bitcoin to give away?

Cryptocurrency faucets are the answer.

The idea at its core is pretty simple. Users can come to a website, enter their wallet address, click a button, complete a captcha, and bitcoin will be sent to their wallet. Easy!

And that would be enough for MVP 1. Future features might include routing users to other faucet sites afterwards. Social media sharing buttons, so they can share with the people they know. Referral bonuses to the user, so they are incentivized to bring in more users. The more value I can provide a user, the more likely they will return.

Unfortunately, it seems that I'm a little bit late to the race.

If you look on the internet, there's thousands of different cryptocurrency faucets out there.

The entire ecosystem has evolved so much. Bitcoin cannot keep up with the number of transactions created, and fees are so high, that faucet sites have switched to using membership systems, where to cash out, a user needs a certain threshold.

Cryptocurrencies interest me, but diving into a saturated market does not.
