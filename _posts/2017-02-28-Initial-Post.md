I was inspired to start my own blog after seeing this blog [post](https://insights.excitingrole.com/why-engineers-should-blog-88ecf97d2628#.2qqauqfjg) by Tim Moore: 


While I certainly don't agree with blanket statements like the one Tim mentions, that all engineers should consider blogging, I nevertheless took his words to heart.
There have been many times in my short career where blogs have made a large impact in my technology decisions.

Blogs provide a large picture than a handful of Stack Overflow answers or forum posts can, and that is why I believe blogs continue to play a large role in the diet of an engineer's research.

I chose to start my blog with Gitpages and Jekyll due to low barrier of entry. We'll see how easy it proves to use.
